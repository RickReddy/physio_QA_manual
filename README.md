# Manually Annotate Physiological Data using MATLAB GUI

This is a quality assessment app developed initially for visualizing and manually assessing the quality of physiological data. MAT files for each subject have to be created, the fields of each MAT file referencing physiological timeseries data for that subject. The user can launch the app and use the sorting buttons and comment box to generate a single csv result file that includes the classification results for each subject(i.e. plot). The details on how to set up the app is listed below. 

## How to use
#### 1. Downloading
Clone or download this repository on to your machine. 

#### 2. Organize your files
In the repository folder, create a folder named `Data`. In this folder, include all MAT files that correspond with subjects that need to quality assessed. The organization of the MAT files should be that each file corresponds to a subject, and each file has multiple fields, a field for each measure of the subject that was taken (for example, there would be one field with data for the heart rate, one field with data for the skin conductance, etc).


#### 3. Launch the app
After you save your changes, you are ready to begin using this app. You can launch it by clicking the `QA_App_v200.m` file downloaded from this repository and then clicking run in MATLAB. After the app is launched, you should see this interface.

If you already have a csv file generated by this program that you want to use, you can click load csv. If you do not have such a file, you can generate a new csv. If you generate a new csv, you will be prompted for a name, and then you will be prompted twice for field names to be used to generate the csv. These 2 field names will be fixed in the csv file, and to change them you will have to directly edit the csv file.

Once you have either loaded or generated a csv, your GUI should look similar to this:

#### 4. Checking the result
The output of this app is a csv file that was named when you pressed generate csv. You can directly access this file to view the results.

#### Note: 
progress will be saved in the csv file, so you can close the app at anytime and continue at a later time as long as you do not make any changes to the repository structure or the output file name.
